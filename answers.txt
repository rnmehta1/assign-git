• What is a gitignore file and what should it include for a Java project? 
	A gitignore is used to tell git to entirely ignore some certain types of files for us. These files won't be tracked by git or pushed by GitHub. For a Java project it should include these files:

1. Compiled class file
*.class

2. Log file
*.log

2. BlueJ files
*.ctxt

3. Mobile Tools for Java (J2ME)
.mtj.tmp/

4. Package Files #
*.jar
*.war
*.nar
*.ear
*.zip
*.tar.gz
*.rar

2. virtual machine crash logs, see http://www.java.com/en/download/help/error_hotspot.xml

• What does fast-forward in Git mean?
A fast-forward is done by git when merging with a branch that is ahead of your branch.

• Why should you have different branches?
Branches help organize the workflow better. Since each developer in a team is working on different things, you can keep workin on your branch regardless of what's happening in other branches.

• In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?
Usually, there is only 1 repository in a project. Although we can have as many remote repositories as we want, but only 1 can be the "origin".
